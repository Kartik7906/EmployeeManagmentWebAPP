# Employee Management Web App

Welcome to the **Employee Management Web App** (EMS Web App). This web application demonstrates the knowledge of **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. The app is designed with two main sections: **Admin** and **Employee**. The Admin can assign tasks with dates and descriptions, while the Employee can accept, reject, or complete the tasks.

This project uses **localStorage** to store sample data for ease of use. However, the project can easily be extended to interact with a backend for data persistence.

You can try the deployed app here:

  - View assigned tasks with detailed descriptions.
  
- **Data Management**:
  - Task data is stored locally in **localStorage** for ease of use.
  - The application is built in a way that it can be easily integrated with a backend (e.g., Node.js with Express and MongoDB) for real-time data updates and persistence.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - **React.js** for building the user interface.
  - **Tailwind CSS** for styling and making the app fully responsive.
  
- **Backend (Optional)**:
  - This project can be easily connected to a backend using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB** (if required).
  
- **Storage**:
  - **localStorage** for storing sample task data.
